			<p><b>FORCE POINTS:</b> 10 FP</p>
			<p><b>SIDE:</b> Universal</p>
			<p>You manipulate the force to reverse gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range.</p>
			<p>All creatures and objects that aren’t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell.</p>
			<p>A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall. If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall.</p>
			<p>If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.</p>
			<p>At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.</p>
			<p><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b></p>
			<p>For every extra 2 FP, you can increase the cylinder height by 10 feet.</p>

			<p><b>FORCE POINTS:</b> 6 FP</p>
			<p><b>SIDE:</b> Universal</p>
			<p>You manipulate the force to create a 20-foot-radius sphere of crushing force that forms at a point you can see within range and tugs at the creatures there.</p>
			<p>Each creature in the sphere must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d10 force damage, and is pulled in a straight line toward the center of the sphere, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible (even if that space is in the air).</p>
			<p>On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pulled.</p>
			<p><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b></p>
			<p>For every extra 2 FP, you can increase the damage by 1d10.</p>
			<p><b><i>Beginnig at level 11, you can cast a diffrent version of the spell:</i></b></p>
			<p><i>For total of 9 FP</i>, you can cast the following spell:</p>
			<p>You manifest a ravine of gravitational energy in a line originating from you that is 100 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 8d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
			<p>Each creature within 10 feet of the line but not in it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 8d8 force damage and be pulled toward the line until the creature is in its area.</p>
			<p><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b></p>
			<p>For every extra 2 FP, you can increase the damage by 1d8.</p>

		<description>
			<p><b>FORCE POINTS:</b> 3 FP</p>
			<p><b>SIDE:</b> Universal</p>
			<p>You manipulate the force to receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes.</p>
			<p>The DM chooses from the following possible omens:</p>
			<p>Weal, for good results</p>
			<p>Woe, for bad results</p>
			<p>Weal and woe, for both good and bad results</p>
			<p>The spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion. </p>
			<p>If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.</p>

			<p><b>FORCE POINTS:</b> 9 FP</p>
			<p><b>SIDE:</b> Dark</p>
			<p>You attempt to bind a creature within an illusory cell that only it perceives. One creature you can see within range must make an Intelligence saving throw. The target succeeds automatically if it is immune to being charmed.</p>
			<p>On a successful save, the target takes 5d10 psychic damage, and the spell ends.</p>
			<p>On a failed save, the target takes 5d10 psychic damage, and you make the area immediately around the target’s space appear dangerous to it in some way. You might cause the target to perceive itself as being surrounded by fire, floating razors, or hideous maws filled with dripping teeth.</p>
			<p>Whatever form the illusion takes, the target can’t see or hear anything beyond it and is restrained for the spell’s duration.</p>
			<p>If the target is moved out of the illusion, makes a melee attack through it, or reaches any part of its body through it, the target takes 10d10 psychic damage, and the spell ends.</p>
			<p><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b></p>
			<p>At level 17, you can cast this without somatic components.</p>
